Subtask 1
Contribution Sentence Identification

Metric: Precision, Recall, F-score

In the paper, the evaluations will be broken down per information unit, but this is not a necessary condition 
for the task participants to optimize on.
Expected output is simply to return all the gold-annotated sentences, regardless of whether or not they are provided as a paragraph in the JSON.

Entity Extraction
By entities is meant subject, predicate, and object entities that will be used in the next phase. This is regardless of the entity role.

Subtask 2.1
End-to-end Pipeline
Entity Extraction on automatically extracted contribution sentences
